**φ-Normalized AI Resonant Framework for Rare-Earth Element Detection**  
Created by Kyung-wook Kim (Lucas) and Protocol Syndicate 86  

---

## 🔭 Overview

RER-AILF is a next-generation geosensing framework combining:

- 🛰️ Satellite hyperspectral imaging (EnMAP)
- 🧲 SQUID magnetometry
- 🔬 LIBS / pXRF field analyzers
- 🤖 Kuramoto-style AI synchronization

It builds a 3D probabilistic REE cube `P_REE(x, y, z)` with RMSE ~80m and 40% CAPEX reduction.
