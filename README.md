[![CI](https://github.com/KyungwookKim86/RER-AILF/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KyungwookKim86/RER-AILF/actions)

## 1. Overview  
RER-AILF fuses satellite hyperspectral, SQUID magnetic-gravity resonance,  
and collective AI phase-locking to localize REEs with sub-100 m accuracy.

## 2. Getting Started  
```bash
git cl. ne https://github.com/KyungwookKim86/RER-AILF.git  
cd RER-AILF  
pip install -r requirements.txt
